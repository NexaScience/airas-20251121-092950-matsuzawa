      "title": "AutoLRS: Automatic Learning-Rate Schedule by Bayesian Optimization on the Fly",
      "abstract": "The learning rate (LR) schedule is one of the most important hyper-parameters needing careful tuning in training DNNs. However, it is also one of the least automated parts of machine learning systems and usually costs significant manual effort and computing. Though there are pre-defined LR schedules and optimizers with adaptive LR, they introduce new hyperparameters that need to be tuned separately for different tasks/datasets. In this paper, we consider the question: Can we automatically tune the LR over the course of training without human involvement? We propose an efficient method, AutoLRS, which automatically optimizes the LR for each training stage by modeling training dynamics. AutoLRS aims to find an LR applied to every $τ$ steps that minimizes the resulted validation loss. We solve this black-box optimization on the fly by Bayesian optimization (BO). However, collecting training instances for BO requires a system to evaluate each LR queried by BO's acquisition function for $τ$ steps, which is prohibitively expensive in practice. Instead, we apply each candidate LR for only $τ'\\llτ$ steps and train an exponential model to predict the validation loss after $τ$ steps. This mutual-training process between BO and the loss-prediction model allows us to limit the training steps invested in the BO search. We demonstrate the advantages and the generality of AutoLRS through extensive experiments of training DNNs for tasks from diverse domains using different optimizers. The LR schedules auto-generated by AutoLRS lead to a speedup of $1.22\\times$, $1.43\\times$, and $1.5\\times$ when training ResNet-50, Transformer, and BERT, respectively, compared to the LR schedules in their original papers, and an average speedup of $1.31\\times$ over state-of-the-art heavily-tuned LR schedules.",

      "title": "Reverse engineering learned optimizers reveals known and novel mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Learned optimizers are algorithms that can themselves be trained to solve optimization problems. In contrast to baseline optimizers (such as momentum or Adam) that use simple update rules derived from theoretical principles, learned optimizers use flexible, high-dimensional, nonlinear parameterizations. Although this can lead to better performance in certain settings, their inner workings remain a mystery. How is a learned optimizer able to outperform a well tuned baseline? Has it learned a sophisticated combination of existing optimization techniques, or is it implementing completely new behavior? In this work, we address these questions by careful analysis and visualization of learned optimizers. We study learned optimizers trained from scratch on three disparate tasks, and discover that they have learned interpretable mechanisms, including: momentum, gradient clipping, learning rate schedules, and a new form of learning rate adaptation. Moreover, we show how the dynamics of learned optimizers enables these behaviors. Our results help elucidate the previously murky understanding of how learned optimizers work, and establish tools for interpreting future learned optimizers.",

      "title": "Budgeted Training: Rethinking Deep Neural Network Training Under Resource Constraints",
      "abstract": "In most practical settings and theoretical analyses, one assumes that a model can be trained until convergence. However, the growing complexity of machine learning datasets and models may violate such assumptions. Indeed, current approaches for hyper-parameter tuning and neural architecture search tend to be limited by practical resource constraints. Therefore, we introduce a formal setting for studying training under the non-asymptotic, resource-constrained regime, i.e., budgeted training. We analyze the following problem: \"given a dataset, algorithm, and fixed resource budget, what is the best achievable performance?\" We focus on the number of optimization iterations as the representative resource. Under such a setting, we show that it is critical to adjust the learning rate schedule according to the given budget. Among budget-aware learning schedules, we find simple linear decay to be both robust and high-performing. We support our claim through extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models on ImageNet (image classification), Kinetics (video classification), MS COCO (object detection and instance segmentation), and Cityscapes (semantic segmentation). We also analyze our results and find that the key to a good schedule is budgeted convergence, a phenomenon whereby the gradient vanishes at the end of each allowed budget. We also revisit existing approaches for fast convergence and show that budget-aware learning schedules readily outperform such approaches under (the practical but under-explored) budgeted training setting.",

      "abstract": "We present QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability. To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more. When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 8%, with several families of models showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's r^2 = 0.36) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that some models may have partially memorized GSM8k. Nevertheless, many models, especially those on the frontier, show minimal signs of overfitting, and all models broadly demonstrate generalization to novel math problems guaranteed to not be in their training data.",

We find that the ability to solve MGSM problems via chain-of-thought prompting emerges with increasing model scale, and that models have strikingly strong multilingual reasoning abilities, even in underrepresented languages such as Bengali and Swahili. Finally, we show that the multilingual reasoning abilities of language models extend to other tasks such as commonsense reasoning and word-in-context semantic judgment.

      "abstract": "Training a modern machine learning architecture on a new task requires extensive learning-rate tuning, which comes at a high computational cost. Here we develop new Polyak-type adaptive learning rates that can be used on top of any momentum method, and require less tuning to perform well. We first develop MoMo, a Momentum Model based adaptive learning rate for SGD-M (stochastic gradient descent with momentum). MoMo uses momentum estimates of the losses and gradients sampled at each iteration to build a model of the loss function. Our model makes use of any known lower bound of the loss function by using truncation, e.g. most losses are lower-bounded by zero. The model is then approximately minimized at each iteration to compute the next step. We show how MoMo can be used in combination with any momentum-based method, and showcase this by developing MoMo-Adam, which is Adam with our new model-based adaptive learning rate. We show that MoMo attains a $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$ convergence rate for convex problems with interpolation, needing knowledge of no problem-specific quantities other than the optimal value. Additionally, for losses with unknown lower bounds, we develop on-the-fly estimates of a lower bound, that are incorporated in our model. We show that MoMo and MoMo-Adam improve over SGD-M and Adam in terms of robustness to hyperparameter tuning for training image classifiers on MNIST, CIFAR, and Imagenet, for recommender systems on Criteo, for a transformer model on the translation task IWSLT14, and for a diffusion model.",

Closely related work such as “Adaptive Gradient Clipping”, “AdaLoss”, or “Loss-aware large-batch training” either rescales the gradient, not the global LR, or makes the LR proportional to √L, not to a bounded ratio around 1, and therefore changes the optimizer’s preconditioner or requires line-search–like steps.  The proposed technique is therefore new in (1) its plug-and-play, one-line insertion after loss computation, (2) its compatibility with any preset schedule, and (3) its focus on stabilising extremely small fine-tuning runs of large LMs, a setting that has not been explicitly addressed by previous loss-based LR adaptations.",

Intuition: if loss spikes (indicating difficult or unstable step) then f_t < 1 reduces LR and prevents divergence; if loss keeps decreasing then f_t > 1 mildly boosts LR and accelerates progress. Implementation is a ~20-line helper class and one assignment inside the training loop, adding near-zero overhead and no extra gradients or parameters.

Built upon extensive training, Qwen3 delivers groundbreaking advancements in reasoning, instruction-following, agent capabilities, and multilingual support, with the following key features:\n\n- **Uniquely support of seamless switching between thinking mode** (for complex logical reasoning, math, and coding) and **non-thinking mode** (for efficient, general-purpose dialogue) **within single model**, ensuring optimal performance across various scenarios.\n- **Significantly enhancement in its reasoning capabilities**, surpassing previous QwQ (in thinking mode) and Qwen2.5 instruct models (in non-thinking mode) on mathematics, code generation, and commonsense logical reasoning.\n- **Superior human preference alignment**, excelling in creative writing, role-playing, multi-turn dialogues, and instruction following, to deliver a more natural, engaging, and immersive conversational experience.\n- **Expertise in agent capabilities**, enabling precise integration with external tools in both thinking and unthinking modes and achieving leading performance among open-source models in complex agent-based tasks.\n- **Support of 100+ languages and dialects** with strong capabilities for **multilingual instruction following** and **translation**.\n\n## Model Overview\n\n**Qwen3-0.6B** has the following features:\n- Type: Causal Language Models\n- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\n- Number of Parameters: 0.6B\n- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 0.44B\n- Number of Layers: 28\n- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 16 for Q and 8 for KV\n- Context Length: 32,768 \n\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If you encounter significant endless repetitions, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section for optimal sampling parameters, and set the ``presence_penalty`` to 1.5.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nThe code of Qwen3 has been in the latest Hugging Face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.\n\nWith `transformers<4.51.0`, you will encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: 'qwen3'\n```\n\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs. \n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B\"\n\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\n    device_map=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language model.\"\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True # Switches between thinking and non-thinking modes. Default is True.\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=32768\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() \n\n# parsing thinking content\ntry:\n    # rindex finding 151668 (</think>)\n    index = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)\nexcept ValueError:\n    index = 0\n\nthinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\n\nprint(\"thinking content:\", thinking_content)\nprint(\"content:\", content)\n```\n\nFor deployment, you can use `sglang>=0.4.6.post1` or `vllm>=0.8.5` or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:\n- SGLang:\n    ```shell\n    python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --reasoning-parser qwen3\n    ```\n- vLLM:\n    ```shell\n    vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1\n    ```\n\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\n\n## Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Mode\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The `enable_thinking` switch is also available in APIs created by SGLang and vLLM. \n> Please refer to our documentation for [SGLang](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/sglang.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) and [vLLM](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) users.\n\n### `enable_thinking=True`\n\nBy default, Qwen3 has thinking capabilities enabled, similar to QwQ-32B. This means the model will use its reasoning abilities to enhance the quality of generated responses. For example, when explicitly setting `enable_thinking=True` or leaving it as the default value in `tokenizer.apply_chat_template`, the model will engage its thinking mode.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True  # True is the default value for enable_thinking\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will generate think content wrapped in a `<think>...</think>` block, followed by the final response.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For thinking mode, use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0` (the default setting in `generation_config.json`). **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.\n\n\n### `enable_thinking=False`\n\nWe provide a hard switch to strictly disable the model's thinking behavior, aligning its functionality with the previous Qwen2.5-Instruct models. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where disabling thinking is essential for enhancing efficiency.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=False  # Setting enable_thinking=False disables thinking mode\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will not generate any think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For non-thinking mode, we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.\n\n### Advanced Usage: Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Modes via User Input\n\nWe provide a soft switch mechanism that allows users to dynamically control the model's behavior when `enable_thinking=True`. Specifically, you can add `/think` and `/no_think` to user prompts or system messages to switch the model's thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.\n\nHere is an example of a multi-turn conversation:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nclass QwenChatbot:\n    def __init__(self, model_name=\"Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B\"):\n        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.history = []\n\n    def generate_response(self, user_input):\n        messages = self.history + [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}]\n\n        text = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            messages,\n            tokenize=False,\n            add_generation_prompt=True\n        )\n\n        inputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n        response_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\n        response = self.tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n\n        # Update history\n        self.history.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input})\n        self.history.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response})\n\n        return response\n\n# Example Usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    chatbot = QwenChatbot()\n\n    # First input (without /think or /no_think tags, thinking mode is enabled by default)\n    user_input_1 = \"How many r's in strawberries?\"\n    print(f\"User: {user_input_1}\")\n    response_1 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_1)\n    print(f\"Bot: {response_1}\")\n    print(\"----------------------\")\n\n    # Second input with /no_think\n    user_input_2 = \"Then, how many r's in blueberries? /no_think\"\n    print(f\"User: {user_input_2}\")\n    response_2 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_2)\n    print(f\"Bot: {response_2}\") \n    print(\"----------------------\")\n\n    # Third input with /think\n    user_input_3 = \"Really? /think\"\n    print(f\"User: {user_input_3}\")\n    response_3 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_3)\n    print(f\"Bot: {response_3}\")\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For API compatibility, when `enable_thinking=True`, regardless of whether the user uses `/think` or `/no_think`, the model will always output a block wrapped in `<think>...</think>`. However, the content inside this block may be empty if thinking is disabled.\n> When `enable_thinking=False`, the soft switches are not valid. Regardless of any `/think` or `/no_think` tags input by the user, the model will not generate think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n## Agentic Use\n\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\n\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\n```python\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n\n# Define LLM\nllm_cfg = {\n    'model': 'Qwen3-0.6B',\n\n    # Use the endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio:\n    # 'model_type': 'qwen_dashscope',\n    # 'api_key': os.getenv('DASHSCOPE_API_KEY'),\n\n    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n    'model_server': 'http://localhost:8000/v1',  # api_base\n    'api_key': 'EMPTY',\n\n    # Other parameters:\n    # 'generate_cfg': {\n    #         # Add: When the response content is `<think>this is the thought</think>this is the answer;\n    #         # Do not add: When the response has been separated by reasoning_content and content.\n    #         'thought_in_content': True,\n    #     },\n}\n\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n    {'mcpServers': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n            'time': {\n                'command': 'uvx',\n                'args': ['mcp-server-time', '--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai']\n            },\n            \"fetch\": {\n                \"command\": \"uvx\",\n                \"args\": [\"mcp-server-fetch\"]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n  'code_interpreter',  # Built-in tools\n]\n\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen'}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\n    pass\nprint(responses)\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\n\n1. **Sampling Parameters**:\n   - For thinking mode (`enable_thinking=True`), use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.\n   - For non-thinking mode (`enable_thinking=False`), we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`.\n   - For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\n\n2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\n\n3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\n   - **Math Problems**: Include \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" in the prompt.\n   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: \"Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `\"answer\": \"C\"`.\"\n\n4. **No Thinking Content in History**: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2.

The dataset was created to support the task of question answering on basic mathematical problems that require multi-step reasoning.\n- These problems take between 2 and 8 steps to solve.\n- Solutions primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations (+ − ×÷) to reach the final answer.\n- A bright middle school student should be able to solve every problem: from the paper, \"Problems require no concepts beyond the level of early Algebra, and the vast majority of problems can be solved without explicitly defining a variable.\"\n- Solutions are provided in natural language, as opposed to pure math expressions. From the paper: \"We believe this is the most generally useful data format, and we expect it to shed light on the properties of large language models’ internal monologues\"\"\n\n### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards\n\nThis dataset is generally used to test logic and math in language modelling.\nIt has been used for many benchmarks, including the [LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard).\n\n### Languages\n\nThe text in the dataset is in English. The associated BCP-47 code is `en`.\n\n## Dataset Structure\n\n### Data Instances\n\nFor the `main` configuration, each instance contains a string for the grade-school level math question and a string for the corresponding answer with multiple steps of reasoning and calculator annotations (explained [here](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math#calculation-annotations)).\n\n\n```python\n{\n    'question': 'Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?',\n    'answer': 'Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\\nNatalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.\\n#### 72',\n}\n```\n\nFor the `socratic` configuration, each instance contains a string for a grade-school level math question, a string for the corresponding answer with multiple steps of reasoning, calculator annotations (explained [here](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math#calculation-annotations)), and *Socratic sub-questions*.\n\n```python\n{\n    'question': 'Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?',\n    'answer': 'How many clips did Natalia sell in May? ** Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\\nHow many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? ** Natalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.\\n#### 72',\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fields\n\nThe data fields are the same among `main` and `socratic` configurations and their individual splits.\n\n- question: The question string to a grade school math problem.\n\n- answer: The full solution string to the `question`. It contains multiple steps of reasoning with calculator annotations and the final numeric solution.\n\n### Data Splits\n\n| name   |train|validation|\n|--------|----:|---------:|\n|main    | 7473|      1319|\n|socratic| 7473|      1319|\n\n## Dataset Creation\n\n### Curation Rationale\n\n[Needs More Information]\n\n### Source Data\n\n#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization\n\nFrom the paper, appendix A:\n\n> We initially collected a starting set of a thousand problems and natural language solutions by hiring freelance contractors on Upwork (upwork.com). We then worked with Surge AI (surgehq.ai), an NLP data labeling platform, to scale up our data collection. After collecting the full dataset, we asked workers to re-solve all problems, with no workers re-solving problems they originally wrote. We checked whether their final answers agreed with the original solutions, and any problems that produced disagreements were either repaired or discarded. We then performed another round of agreement checks on a smaller subset of problems, finding that 1.7% of problems still produce disagreements among contractors. We estimate this to be the fraction of problems that contain breaking errors or ambiguities. It is possible that a larger percentage of problems contain subtle errors.\n\n#### Who are the source language producers?\n\n[Needs More Information]\n\n### Annotations\n\n#### Annotation process\n\n[Needs More Information]\n\n#### Who are the annotators?\n\nSurge AI (surgehq.ai)\n\n### Personal and Sensitive Information\n\n[Needs More Information]\n\n## Considerations for Using the Data\n\n### Social Impact of Dataset\n\n[Needs More Information]\n\n### Discussion of Biases\n\n[Needs More Information]\n\n### Other Known Limitations\n\n[Needs More Information]\n\n## Additional Information\n\n### Dataset Curators\n\n[Needs More Information]\n\n### Licensing Information\n\nThe GSM8K dataset is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n### Citation Information\n\n```bibtex\n@article{cobbe2021gsm8k,\n  title={Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems},\n  author={Cobbe, Karl and Kosaraju, Vineet and Bavarian, Mohammad and Chen, Mark and Jun, Heewoo and Kaiser, Lukasz and Plappert, Matthias and Tworek, Jerry and Hilton, Jacob and Nakano, Reiichiro and Hesse, Christopher and Schulman, John},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14168},\n  year={2021}\n}\n```\n\n### Contributions\n\nThanks to [@jon-tow](https://github.com/jon-tow) for adding this dataset."
